    System Structure
1. User:
   - Represents the different users interacting with the system, including workers and clients.

2. Admin:
   - Admin users responsible for validation and account activation.
   - Validates users (workers and clients) to ensure authenticity.
   - Activates user accounts after successful validation.

3. LabourConnect System:
   - Central component of the system that coordinates the interactions.
   - Collects and processes user input data (worker or client information).
   - Matches clients with suitable workers based on specified areas.
   - Allows clients to send reviews after receiving services.
   - Checks if all required steps are true for both users and the system.

Flow of the System:

- Users initiate the process by providing input data.
- Clients specify the desired geographical area for worker matching.
- Users can send reviews after services.
- Admins validate users' authenticity and activate their accounts.
- Admins validate clients and workers for successful system entry.
- The system processes user data and matches workers with clients.
- The system checks if all steps are true for clients and workers.
- If all steps are true:
  - The system confirms that all required conditions are met and ends.
  - Clients and users are informed that the process is complete.
- If any step is not true:
  - The system stops and informs users that conditions are not met.
  - The process ends without further actions.
